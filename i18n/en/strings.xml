  <!-- XTXT: Booster Notification Rule: BNR-DE-0300, BMG-Empfehlung Booster  -->
  <string name="BNR-DE-0300">"The German Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) recommends that everyone who has not been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and who received their basic immunization more than 6 months ago make an appointment to get a booster vaccination or obtain medical advice regarding the benefits of a booster vaccination. Scientific studies have proven that booster vaccinations give you better vaccination protection against COVID-19 infection.\n\nSince your saved certificates indicate that these criteria apply to you and that you have not had a booster vaccination yet, we wish to draw your attention to this recommendation. (Rule BNR-DE-0300)\n\nThis information is based solely on the certificates saved in your smartphone. The data was processed on your smartphone. No data has been sent to the RKI or to third parties."</string>
